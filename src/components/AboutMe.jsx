              Hello! I'm Francisco Gutierrez, a versatile software development
              professional with a broad technical skill set including full-stack
              development and cybersecurity. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in
              Software Development from Westwood College and a recent
              certification from San Diego State University, I am committed to
              leveraging my technical expertise and teaching experience to

              I am passionate about
              continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry
              trends. I enjoy working on challenging projects that require
              innovative solutions and collaborating with others to achieve
              common goals.

              When I'm not working, I enjoy games, both board games, and video games, excercising, spending time with my family, and exploring new
              technologies. Feel free to connect with me through the following
              platforms:
